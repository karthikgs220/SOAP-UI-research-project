Web Services are very popular these days and they can be used to further extend the functionality of your application. 
Once the application is hosted on a web service, they can be used on other applications as an extended service / framework. 
The most commonly used Web Services are REST and SOAP. These consist of APIs which assist the application to do specific operations and functionalities. 
SOAP UI is an automation test tool used to test such REST and SOAP web services. 
SOAPUI allows testers to execute automated functional, regression, compliance, and load tests on different Web API. 
SOAP UI has a GUI and Command Line based approach to testing these Web Services which enables Technical and Non-Technical users to use the tool conveniently. 
SOAP UI is a free software and was released in 2011 by Eviware Software. They also have a Pro version of the tool which mainly aims at making recurring tasks easier.

The purpose of this research project is to shed light on the usability and the use case scenarios of the popular testing tool whichb is prominently used widely in projects of all sizes.
The report gives a comprehensive summary of the tool usage and features, it also mentions the covergage methods and considers example test cases to prove the tool's simplicity.
